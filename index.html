        <h2 class="section__title">Introduction</h2>
        <div class="section__content-container">
          <p class="section__text">The dataset used for this analysis is a speed dating study conducted at Columbia University from 2002 to 2004. The study involved a total of 551 participants, with 274 women and 277 men. Our objective is to analyze a wide range of factors ranging from race and gender to hobbies and perception of a partner.</p>

        <h2 class="section__title">What is Speed Dating?</h2>
        <div class="section__content-container">
          <p class="section__text">Speed dating is a popular way for people to meet new people in a short amount of time. Participants are paired up in random groups and rotate partners every few minutes. Each pair has a few minutes to get to know each other and decide if they would like to see each other again. After the event, participants submit a list of who they would like to see again. The organizers of the event then use this information to inform future events, or in the case of the Columbia study - the data is used for research (and projects like this!)</p>

        <h2 class="section__title">Study Participant Age Distribution</h2>
        <div class="section__content-container">
          <p class="section__text">We begin by analyzing the data to understand the characteristics of our sample. From the visual, we can see that the majority of participants were in their 20s and early 30s. The age distribution for women and men is similar, with a slightly higher proportion of men in their 30s.</p>

        <h2 class="section__title">Participant Fields of Study</h2>
          <div class="section__content-container">
            <p class="section__text">The visual shows that an overwhelming amount of men preferred business/economics/finance over the rest of the fields, while women chose to study education/academia. However, we can see a more linear increase in the second and third most popular fields of study for both men and women. When we separate the data by race, we can observe some interesting patterns. Business/economics/finance was the most popular field for all but Black/African Americans (where law placed first). However, only engineering was in the top three fields for Asians, even though it was the second most popular for men overall.</p>

        <h2 class="section__title">Distribution Across Race & Gender</h2>
        <div class="section__content-container">
          <p class="section__text">From the visual, we can see that White/Caucasians consist of over half the entire sample for both males and females, while Asians came in second at nearly a quarter for both women and men. This may be important when considering potential imbalances or inaccuracies in the samples, especially for underrepresented races like Black or Other.</p>

        <h2 class="section__title">Success Rates by Race & Gender</h2>
        <div class="section__content-container">
          <p class="section__text">Finally for general analysis, we analyzed the success rates for each race based on gender. The following bar graph shows the success rates for each gender in the dating scene. From the visual, we can see that females had a higher chance of matching in all but Caucasian males. However, it's worth noting that this data shouldn't be the main point of our analysis since certain races had sample sizes that were too small. In conclusion, this analysis provides valuable insights into the characteristics of our sample in this study.By understanding this, we can make better interpretations of the data and draw more accurate conclusions. The next Section provides the data and factors that affect the success rates of a person.</p>

        <h2 class="section__title">Match Preferences by Gender</h2>
        <div class="section__content-container">
          <p class="section__text">This specific segment of the study aimed to explore the preferences of individuals when it comes to selecting a romantic partner.Participants were asked to rate the importance of six attributes: intelligence, physical attractiveness, ambition, sincerity, being fun, and shared interests/hobbies. They were then asked to assign a score of 1-10 or 1-100 to each attribute based on their personal preferences. The study found that there were significant differences in the preferences of men and women. While both genders placed importance on physical attractiveness, men rated it as their top priority followed by intelligence. Women, on the other hand, rated intelligence as their top priority followed by physical attractiveness. The study also found that shared interests/hobbies were the least important attribute for both men and women. This suggests that while shared interests can be a positive factor in a relationship, they are not necessarily a key determinant in partner selection.</p>

        <h2 class="section__title">Ratings vs Decision</h2>
        <div class="section__content-container">
          <p class="section__text">As we previously discussed, men rated physical attractiveness as the most important attribute in a female partner. To see whether this preference translated into actual success, the study analyzed the average decision rates (yes/no) for each score attributed for attractiveness on a scale of 1-10 of their dates. As we know, men rated their dates physical attractiveness as the most important trait when making a decision. Lets see if this is true.</p>

        <p class="section__text">If we see the ratings of attractiveness that women gave to their dates attributed to their decision rates, we can see a very different story.</p>
