        <p class="section__text">Speed dating is a popular way for people to meet new people in a short amount of time. Participants are paired up in random groups and rotate partners every few minutes. Each pair has a few minutes to get to know each other and decide if they would like to see each other again. After the event, participants submit a list of who they would like to see again. The organizers of the event then use this information to inform future events.</p>
